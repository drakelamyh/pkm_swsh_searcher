# Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield Searcher
Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield Searcher using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

For those who play Pokemon Sword and Shield, you sometimes need to check Pokedex information. However, as there are many different versions of Pokemon from Gen 1 to Gen 8, you may therefore be looking up at the wrong Gen's information if you were to do a simple search on the internet.

Serebii.net provides useful information and is very comprehensive (in my opinion). However, the controls can be difficult to navigate as the font size and dropdown lists are small. Using their search function may also not guarantee that the results pulled out are for Gen 8 (Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield).

This simple search box created makes use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript capabilities to concatenate the name of the Pokemon with the URL extension meant for Serebii.net Sword & Shield Pokedex.
