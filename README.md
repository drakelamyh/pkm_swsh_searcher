Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield Searcher

For those who are playing Pokemon Sword and Shield, you sometimes need to check Pokedex information. However, there are very versions of Pokemon (Gen 1 to Gen 8). You may therefore be looking at the wrong information if you were to do a simple search on the internet.

Serebii.net provides useful information and is very comprehensive. However, the controls can be difficult to navigate as the font size and dropdown lists are small. Using their search function may also not guarantee that the results pulled out are for Gen 8.

This simple search box makes use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript capabilities to concatenate the name of the Pokemon with the URL extension meant for Serebii.net Sword & Shield Pokedex.
